## Desciprtion

The detection of malicious software (malware) is an important problem in cyber security, especially as more of society becomes dependent on computing systems.

This is the implementation of MalConv proposed in [Malware Detection by Eating a Whole EXE.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09435.pdf)

**Our model:**

## Dependency

Please make sure each of them is installed with the correct version

- numpy (1.14.0)
- pytorch (0.4.0)
- sklearn (0.19.1)
- matplotlib (2.1.2)

We used python **2.7** for this project. 

## Get the Data

We took our data from the [BIU Cyber center](https://cyber.biu.ac.il/).

You can use alternative data from  [Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data).

### Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Gatak |
| 2 | Kelihos |
| 3 | Kryptik |
| 4 | Lollipop |
| 5 | Benign |
| 6 | Ramnit |
| 7 | Simda |
| 8 | Vundo |
| 9 | Zbot |

## Setup
### Preparing data
##### Step 1
Please prepare a folder with the data, each label with separate folder. 

It should look like this:

![](img/data.png)

##### Step 2
On **classes.txt**:

You need put the path of the main directory (containing all the labels's folder) on the first line.

On the second line you need to specify which labels you want to check.

For example: 

        /Users/haimgil/Desktop/malwareData
        Benign Ramnit Zbot Kelihos
In this example we checked only 4 classes.
##### Step 3
On **Main.py**:

Edit **num_of_classes** to match the number of labels you putted on the second line in **classes.txt**

### Running

Run the following command for training progress:

        python Main.py <use_cpu> <batch_size> <num_of_classes>
        Example 1 : python Main.py 2 64 9
        Example 2 : python Main.py
        
### Results
We tested our model on 4 classes: Benign, Ramnit, Zbot and Kelihos.

When we tested on 9 classes we achieved 85% at most. The reason is that
